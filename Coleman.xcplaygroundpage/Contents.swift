Prior to becoming the Mayor, he was elected to the Michigan State Senate. Inequities in state funding were pointed out by him during his tenure in the Senate, for example, stating that $20 million was spent on rural bus service, while nothing is spent for the same service in Detroit.  During his senate career he constructed the Joe Louis Arena and upgraded the cityâ€™s mass transit system.  He challenged the increase of police violence that caused black residents in Detroit to suffer in the early 1970s.  By 1993, his effect on integrating the Detroit Police Department allowed more than 50% of the force to have black police.  His economic development and successful management of two fiscal crises were remarkable.  He put the financing package together for the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, which has honored him with a wing named after him.  Many other projects included the development of the Renaissance Center, Detroit People Mover, Detroit Receiving Hospital, the Millender Center Apartment, Harbortown, One Detroit Center, the Fox Theater restoration, Riverfront Condominiums, the Chrysler Jefferson North Assembly Plant and the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Plant.")
